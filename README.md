# Design-and-Implementation-of-Electric-Elevator-Control-System
This project focuses on designing and implementing an electric elevator control system using Verilog HDL, tailored for FPGA/CPLD deployment. The system ensures smooth, efficient, and reliable elevator operations, simulating real-world behavior with both internal and external controls.
